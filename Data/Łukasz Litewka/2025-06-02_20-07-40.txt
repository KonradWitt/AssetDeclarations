error: The first name and last name extracted from the OCR document ("aitenka Lukave") do not match the first name and last name provided in the CSV data ("≈Åukasz Litewka"). This is a direct contradiction and not a case of a missing second name. According to the instructions, I must return an error in this scenario.

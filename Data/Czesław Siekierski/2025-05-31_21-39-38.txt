error: Cannot convert income values from EUR to PLN for the `yearlyValue` field in the `Income` objects, as I do not have access to historical NBP exchange rates for the declaration date (2025-03-30). The `yearlyValue` field is defined as a number, implying a single currency (PLN in this context), and the instructions require conversion for foreign currencies if no PLN equivalent is provided.
